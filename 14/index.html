		// You might think we can just do something like this:
		team[3] = 'Lux';
		console.log(players, team);

		// however what happens when we update that array?

		// now here is the problem!

		// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

		// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

		// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
		
		// one way
		players[3] = 'Poppy';
		const team2 = players.slice();

		// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

		// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

		// with Objects
		const person = {
			name: 'Wes Bos',
			age: 80
		};

		// and think we make a copy:
		const captain = person;
		// captain.name = 'Aaron Horeth';

		// console.log(person, captain);

		// how do we take a copy instead?
		const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Aaron Horeth'});

		// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

		// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
